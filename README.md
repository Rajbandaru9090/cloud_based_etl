🧠 Problem Statement
Businesses often struggle with building scalable, maintainable data pipelines to move raw data from cloud storage to analytical databases for dashboards or AI applications. This project solves that problem by building a production-grade, cloud-native ETL pipeline using Airflow, AWS S3, and AWS RDS (PostgreSQL).

🎯 Project Goals
Automate ingestion of raw data from AWS S3

Perform real-time data cleaning and transformation using Python (Pandas)

Store clean data back into S3 (intermediate zone)

Load transformed data into AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)

Orchestrate the full process using Apache Airflow on a cloud-friendly Docker setup

Set the foundation for dashboarding or AI models

🧰 Tech Stack
Layer	Tool/Service
Orchestration	Apache Airflow (Docker)
Data Storage	AWS S3 (raw & processed zones)
Processing	Python (Pandas)
Data Warehouse	AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)
Infrastructure	Docker + Cloud Setup (Optional ECS/EC2)

🗂️ Data Flow Steps
Ingestion

Raw CSVs are downloaded and uploaded to AWS S3 (raw/ bucket).

Transformation

Airflow DAG triggers a Python script to:

Read CSVs from S3

Clean and transform using Pandas (e.g., handle missing values, column renaming, datetime conversions)

Save cleaned files back to S3 (processed/ bucket)

Loading

Airflow task loads the cleaned data from S3 into AWS RDS PostgreSQL using psycopg2 or SQLAlchemy

Success Email Notification

Upon completion, email notification is triggered.
✅ Key Features
⛅ Cloud-Native: Data stored and accessed through AWS S3 and AWS RDS

⚙️ Modular ETL: Separated concerns into ingest → clean → load

🔁 Automated Pipelines: Scheduled or triggered DAGs in Airflow

🧼 Clean Code: Pythonic data cleaning with Pandas

🔐 Secure AWS Access: IAM roles or credentials separation

📈 Dashboard-Ready: Final data is PostgreSQL-ready for Power BI or Streamlit

📊 Sample Transformations
Fill missing values

Convert timestamps to datetime

Calculate total_price = quantity * unit_price

Remove duplicates

Normalize product/category names

Filter invalid regions or records
 Future Enhancements
Add data validation using Great Expectations

Add dbt for post-load transformation

Add Streamlit dashboard on cleaned PostgreSQL data

Integrate Airflow on AWS MWAA for full cloud deployment

Enable versioning and logging on S3

✨ Outcome
A fully working cloud-based ETL pipeline used to move, clean, and store real-world e-commerce data for analytics or AI models. Ready for interviews, dashboards, and real production use cases.
